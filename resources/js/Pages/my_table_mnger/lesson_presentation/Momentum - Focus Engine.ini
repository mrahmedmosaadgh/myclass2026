Momentum - Focus Engine

### 🚀 Rocket Brain – "Turn your brain into a rocket ship!"

Here is the ultimate "Super Brain Booster" for Grade 4 students. It’s not work—it’s a mission.

#### Core Philosophy
Turn "boring homework time" into an exciting space mission where you unlock cool pets and badges.

### 1. The Launch Sequence ("Blast Off!")
- **Start Timer**: "3… 2… 1… BLAST OFF!" (Rocket launch sound 🚀)
- **Mission Control (The Timer)**:
  - **Quick Win**: 10 min (for easy stuff)
  - **Super Focus Mission**: 20 min (for big projects)
  - **Recharge**: 5 min (get a snack!)
- **Smart Boost**: If you finish early, you get "Bonus Fuel" (extra points).

### 2. Mission Report (Super Fast)
After the timer ends → Victory Fanfare! 🎺 "YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE!"

One-tap check-in:
┌───────────────────────┐
│ What did you crush?    │
│ [Math] [Reading]       │
│ [Writing] [Art]        │
│ [Science] [Other]      │
└───────────────────────┘
┌───────────────────────┐
│ How do you feel?       │
│ 🤩 Super!  🙂 Good     │
│ 😐 Okay    😴 Sleepy   │
└───────────────────────┘

### 3. The Launchpad (Next Move)
Don't look at a long boring list. Just look at the **Launchpad**:

1.  **The Big Boss**: The #1 most important thing to do.
2.  **Side Quest**: A smaller, easier task.
3.  **Mystery Box**: A fun or random task!

Pick one and BLAST OFF!

### 4. The "Secret Base" (Collectibles & Rewards)
This is why you want to focus.

-   **The Loop**: Every 5 missions completed → **HATCH A NEW PET!** 🥚
    -   Egg cracks open...
    -   It's a **Panda**! 🐼
    -   Next: **Dragon** 🐉 -> **Unicorn** 🦄 -> **Robot** 🤖 -> **Alien** 👽
-   **Streaks**: 5 days in a row = "Superhero Whoosh" sound + "Focus Ninja" Badge.
-   **End of Day**: A cool 8-second movie showing all your wins!

### 5. Weekly Hero Stats (For Parents/Teachers)
A simple weekly email to Mom or Dad:

"Ava blasted through **42 Rocket Brain missions** this week and earned the **Math Wizard** badge! 🧙‍♀️"

### 6. Cool Modes
-   **Cockpit Mode**: Buttons, lights, and controls.
-   **Secret Base**: See all your hatched pets hanging out.
-   **Zen Mode**: Just space and stars. 🌌

### 7. Emergency Buttons
-   **"Help!"**: Pauses the timer so you can ask a parent.
-   **"Warp Speed"**: Adds 5 minutes if you are ALMOST done.

### Final Result
You don't "do work." You play **Rocket Brain**.
You hatch dragons, earn badges, and turn into a productivity superhero.

"Can I do Rocket Brain now??" - Every Grade 4 student.
