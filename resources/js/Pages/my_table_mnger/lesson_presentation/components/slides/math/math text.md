## Answer Key

### Lesson 2-5: Graph Proportional Relationships
1. $k = 3$; $\$21$
2. Yes; 40 pages
3. No; The graph would be a straight line, but it would **not** pass through the origin (0, 0) due to the starting fee.
4. $k = 5$; $(1, 5)$
5. D) (0, 0)

### Lesson 2-6: Apply Proportional Reasoning to Solve Problems
1. 900 miles
2. 10 cups $\left(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{x}\right)$
3. 3 hours (More workers means less time: $\left. 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ total hours; } 30 \div 10 = 3 \right)$
4. $16/20$ or $4/5$; 32
5. 8 hours $\left( 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ total hours; } 24 \div 3 = 8 \right)$

### Lesson 3-1: Analyze Percents of Numbers
1. 7
2. 10 students $(0.25 \times 40)$
3. $\$3$; $\$63$
4. 12 pounds $(1.50 \times 8)$
5. 81 employees $(0.90 \times 90)$

### Lesson 3-2: Connect Percent and Proportion
1. $30\% \left(\frac{24}{80} = \frac{x}{100}\right)$
2. 30 gallons $\left(\frac{x}{50} = \frac{60}{100}\right)$
3. $\$60 \left(\frac{9}{x} = \frac{15}{100}\right)$
4. $70\% \left(\frac{35}{50} = \frac{x}{100}\right)$
5. 40 miles $\left(\frac{8}{x} = \frac{20}{100}\right)$

### Lesson 3-3: Represent and Use the Percent Equation
