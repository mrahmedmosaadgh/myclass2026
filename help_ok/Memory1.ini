🧠 What I Have in Memory for This Project
Project Context:
Stack: Laravel + Inertia + Vue 3 education management system
Location: d:\my_projects\2025\laravel12\myclass8
Current Focus: Offline-first Inertia context optimization with Pinia integration
Your Preferences (from memories):
✅ Prefer .then() style promises over async/await
✅ Use Laravel API + Inertia + Vue 3 stack for education management
✅ Prefer tinyInteger with descriptive comments over boolean fields
✅ Use Quasar UI framework for documentation portal
✅ Prefer tabbed user management interfaces with advanced search
✅ Want 7-day cache expiry for all user context segments
✅ Want Pinia store integration with offline data
✅ Want organized file structure with specific patterns
Current System Analysis:
Existing Offline System: ✅ Already have Dexie.js + offline composables
Current Middleware: HandleInertiaRequests.php with monolithic user context
Existing Stores: userStore.js, networkStore.js, notificationStore.js, AppStore.js
Current Structure: $page.props.auth.user with all data in one object
What We're Building:
Segmented Context: Split user data into 4 segments (profile, permissions, school, classroom, schedule)
7-Day Caching: All segments expire after 7 days
Pinia Integration: Make Pinia stores use offline data seamlessly
Backward Compatibility: Keep existing auth.user structure working
Easy Page Updates: Seamless updates across pages using context
Implementation Plan Status:
Step 1: Modify HandleInertiaRequests.php ⏳ (Ready to implement)
Step 2: Update Dexie schema ⏳ (Pending)
Step 3: Create user context Pinia store ⏳ (Pending)
Step 4: Create Vue composable ⏳ (Pending)
Step 5: Create API endpoints ⏳ (Pending)
Step 6: Migration examples ⏳ (Pending)
Is this accurate? Should I proceed with Step 1?
